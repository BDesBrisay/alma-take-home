# Design Document: Lead Form Application

## Overview
This project focuses on building a dynamic, form-driven UI for managing leads, primarily concentrating on the frontend side. Due to time constraints, I prioritized getting the assessment form styled closely to the provided mock and ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Key Design Decisions

- **JsonForms**: This was my first time using JsonForms, and while there was a bit of a learning curve, it turned out to be a great tool for dynamically generating forms based on JSON schemas. It simplified the process of building a flexible and maintainable form structure.

- **Material-UI**: Used to style the form components, ensuring a consistent and modern look. Material-UI's integration with JsonForms was smooth, and it allowed me to closely match the provided mock.

- **CSS Modules**: I used CSS Modules to keep the styles scoped to individual components, which made it easier to manage and avoid conflicts.

## Challenges
- **Learning Curve**: Since I hadn’t used Next.js in a while and was new to JsonForms, I spent a significant amount of time figuring things out. This impacted my ability to complete the entire assignment, especially the backend API.

- **Backend API**: I didn't implement the backend API as this exercise was frontend-focused, and my time was mainly spent on ensuring the form worked well and looked right.

## Next Steps
If I had more time, I’d implement the backend API and refine the form functionality further. Additionally, I’d like to explore adding state management and unit tests to make the application more robust.

## Conclusion
This exercise was a great opportunity to dive back into Next.js and explore JsonForms. While I didn’t complete everything, I’m pleased with how the frontend turned out and feel confident in extending this further with more time.
